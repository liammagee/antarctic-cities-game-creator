# Antarctic Futures

[Antarctic Futures](http://game.antarctic-cities.org) is an online game developed to research and engage with young people in Antarctic cities, part of the wider [Antarctic Cities ARC (Australian Research Council)](http://antarctic-cities.org) project.

The game is closely modelled on [Plague Inc.](https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc), and developed on the [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/en/products) platform.

This repository contains the source code and associated assets for the game. It also a utility, located under the ./world-atlas directory and documented below, for generating game images of the world and associated countries.

## Installation

1. Install the [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/en/products) platform.
2. Run *Cocos Dashboard*, and under *Projects*, click *Add* and choose the directory containing this repository.
3. Once the project is loaded, click *Project > Play on Device*, or hit the Play button.

To run unit tests and other utilities, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Then open a command line or terminal window, naviate to the repository directory, and run:

    npm i -D typescript
    npm i -D ts-node
    npm i

These instructions will install *TypeScript*, the *TypeScript* mode for *node.js*, and dependencies for *Antarctic Futures*.

## Deployment

To simplify deployment, *Antarctic Futures* includes the *Cocos Creator* 'Web Mobile' build. This enables new builds to be deployed easily.

### Basic server

The simplest way to deploy the game is to clone the repository to a server, and running a basic web server such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) in the build directory:

    http-server -p 8000 build/web-mobile

or

    npm run basic

To check the game loads correctly, visit http://localhost:8000 (if testing from another machne, replace localhost with the server's IP address).

### Logging server

For research purposes, each completed game can also be saved on the server. A customised script, *server.js*, includes a hook for client state to be saved as JSON output. To run this version:

    ./server.js

or

    npm run log

### Lifecycle management

The server can also be run via [foreman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foreman):

    npm run foreman

## Unit Testing

Unit tests, developed using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework, cover parts of the *World* model.

To run the unit tests, open a command line or terminal window, navigate to the repository directory, and run:

    npm t

## Documentation

The *docs/* directory includes two PDFs:

- [Learn-with-Antarctic-Futures.pdf](docs/Learn-with-Antarctic-Futures.pdf): a resource pack for teachers and facilitators to use the game in group settings.
- [model.pdf](docs/model.pdf): documentation about the underlying model the game (and terminal simulator) use.

Code-level (API) documentation can be generated

    npm run doc

## Running the Terminal Simulator

The repository includes a utility that runs a version of the simulator from the terminal. To execute, run:

    ts-node Terminal/Sim.ts

or

    ./Terminal/Sim.ts

The simulator takes a *strategy* argument, which can be one of *none*, *musk*, *soc-dem*, *eco*, *contra* or *mil*, which employ and evaluate different policy strategies.

Examples:

    ts-node Terminal/Sim.ts --strategy musk
    ./Terminal/Sim.ts -s soc-dem

## Customising *Antarctic Futures*

To modify the *Antarctic Futures* code, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the [instructions](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/1.9/manual/en/getting-started/coding-setup.html) provided by the Cocos Creator developers.

The code base is developed entirely in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The code is organised according to a *Model-View-Controller* framework. Key classes containing much of the logic for the game are in the following files:

- *assets/Script/World.js*: contains the logic of the game.
- *assets/Script/GameController.js*: handles control flow, screen rendering and user interaction with the *World* model.

*Cocos Creator* components are used for the *View* aspect of the framework.

## World Atlas

*world.js* generates a tile map XML file, and associatedimages from world maps for the game.

It takes a JSON file that lists countries and their coordinates, generates a canvas image of the world and, optionally, each country, which is then saved.

After processing, these files can be copied to the *./res* folder, where they can used in the game.

### Generate tile map and images

To generate the tile map, first download one of three shape files, available from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/):

- [10m resolution](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/)
- [50m resolution](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/)
- [110m resolution](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/)

In each case, click the 'Download Countries' link. 

Next, unzip the file to the 'world-atlas/data' folder, and convert the shape files from  to GeoJSON format.

Change to the world-atlas directory:

    cd world-atlas/data

Then run the following commands, depending on the desired resolution. *ogr2ogr* depends on [GDAL](https://gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) being available on your machine first.

High resolution:

    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 10m.json ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp

Medium resolution:

    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 50m.json ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp

Low resolution:

    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 110m.json ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp

For cities:

    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 10m-pop-places.json ne_10m_populated_places.shp

Then, run one of the following to extract just the features:

    ndjson-cat 10m.json | ndjson-split 'd.features' > 10m-cat.ndjson
    ndjson-cat 50m.json | ndjson-split 'd.features' > 50m-cat.ndjson
    ndjson-cat 110m.json | ndjson-split 'd.features' > 110m-cat.ndjson

And for cities:

    ndjson-cat 10m-pop-places.json | ndjson-split 'd.features' > 10m-pop-places-cat.ndjson

For the final preparation step, convert the list of features to [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) format:

    geo2topo -n tracts=10m-cat.ndjson > 10m-topo.json
    geo2topo -n tracts=50m-cat.ndjson > 50m-topo.json
    geo2topo -n tracts=110m-cat.ndjson > 110m-topo.json
    geo2topo -n tracts=10m-pop-places-cat.ndjson > 10m-pop-places-topo.json

Then to generate the tile map, background, foreground and individual country images:

    cd ..
    ./world.js -j [one of: data/10m-topo.json, data/50m-topo.json, data/110m-topo.json]

To generate *just* the xml and background and foreground images:

    ./world.js -x

To produce the images in greyscale:

    ./world.js -g

To specify a projection other than stereographic:

    ./world.js -p <>

Or with the full set of images:

    ./world.js -j [one of: data/10m-topo.json, data/50m-topo.json, data/110m-topo.json]

Copy the generated tile map and other files to the resources folder:

    cp cp background-stereographic-greyscale.png ../res/
    cp tmx-test-stereographic.tmx ../res/
